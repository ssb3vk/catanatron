    Where you have to register the player


In sid_experimental, we have two python scripts. The first, unified_tensor_splitter, splits up each dataset by the action_type
The next script, data_unifier, unifies disparate action type directories from individual directories
This way we can just deploy each directory (distinguished by action_type) to the models for training
